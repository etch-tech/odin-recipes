# odin-recipes
This was a project to create 3 recipe pages which are all linked at the index page.

In this project I demonstrated what i learned throughout the odin project.
I learned how to make headers, ordered / unordered lists, and place images on pages.
I also learned how to structure the skeleton of an html file in order to create things on it.
As well as utilize relative links to other pages from a page.
